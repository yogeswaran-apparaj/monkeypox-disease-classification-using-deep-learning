# Monkeypox Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning–based system for multi-class classification of viral skin diseases with a primary focus on Monkeypox. The system uses a hybrid deep learning architecture trained on skin lesion images and is deployed as a Streamlit web application for easy interaction.

This project is developed purely for **academic and educational purposes** and is not intended for real-world medical diagnosis.

## 📌 Project Overview

Monkeypox is a viral infectious disease that causes visible skin lesions similar to other viral skin diseases such as Chickenpox, Measles, and Cowpox. Manual diagnosis based on visual inspection can be challenging due to high similarity between diseases.

This project aims to:
- Automatically classify Monkeypox from skin lesion images
- Apply deep learning techniques for medical image classification
- Analyze model performance using multiple evaluation metrics
- Deploy the trained model as a web application

## 🦠 Disease Classes

The system performs **multi-class classification** for the following categories:

- Monkeypox  
- Chickenpox  
- Cowpox  
- Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD)  
- Measles  
- Healthy Skin
