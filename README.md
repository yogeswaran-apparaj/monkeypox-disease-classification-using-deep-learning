# monkeypox-disease-classification-using-deep-learning
A deep learning–based system for multi-class skin disease classification with a focus on Monkeypox. The project uses a hybrid CNN–Transformer model trained on the MCVSLD dataset, evaluated using ROC, PR curves, Grad-CAM, and deployed as a Streamlit web application for academic and research purposes.
